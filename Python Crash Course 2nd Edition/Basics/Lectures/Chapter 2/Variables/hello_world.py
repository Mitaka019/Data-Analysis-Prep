# Naming and Using Variables

# Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. 

# Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used
# to separate words in variable names.

# Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.

# Variable names should be short but descriptive

# Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O
# because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.

# Python doesn't care about spelling and grammar as long as it's consistent.
